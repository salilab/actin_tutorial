Introduction {#mainpage}
============

Here, we describe integrative modeling using the PMI interface and then
demonstrate its use by modeling the complex of actin and tropomodulin-gelsolin
chimera using SAXS, EM, crosslinking, crystal structures of the individual
domains and physical principles:

- [Description of the design of the PMI software](@ref pmidesign)

- [Modeling of the actin-tropomodulin-gelsolin complex](@ref modeling)

- [Analysis of the actin complex models and deposition](@ref analysis)

First, on to [the design of the PMI software](@ref pmidesign).
