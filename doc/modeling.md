 This complex was solved via X-ray crystallography at 2.3 Ã… resolution (PDB: 4PKI)(Rao and Dominguez, 2014) which we use to derive simulated biophysical data and assess the accuracy of the modeled complexes. In this simple exercise, we assume that we have a crystal structure of only the actin-gelsolin interface and would like to find the tropomyosin-actin binding interface. The entire modeling protocol is summarized in the four-stage diagram (Figure 1).
