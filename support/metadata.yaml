title: Modeling of an actin complex with PMI
description: >
    This demonstratates integrative modeling using the PMI interface by
    modeling the complex of actin and tropomodulin-gelsolin chimera using SAXS,
    EM, crosslinking, crystal structures of the individual domains and
    physical principles.
